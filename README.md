# MECAF
Differential abundance test
 In this study, we propose a novel test for identifying the difference between two high-dimensional microbiome abundance data matrices based on the centred log-ratio transformation of the microbiome compositions. The test p-value can be calculated directly with a closed-form solution from the derived asymptotic null distribution. We also investigate the asymptotic statistical  power against sparse alternatives which are typically encountered in microbiome studies. The proposed Maximum-type test is Equal-Covariance-Assumption-Free, making it widely applicable to studies that compare microbiome compositions between conditions. Our simulation studies demonstrated that the proposed MECAF test achieves desirable power than competing methods while having the type I error rate well controlled under various scenarios.The usefulness of the proposed test is further illustrated with two real microbiome data analyses.
